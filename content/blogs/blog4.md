# Hey!

I am Vanshika Bhatia and I am 22 years old. I come from India, a country in South East Asia. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala, India. After that I joined JP Morgan.

## Quantitative Researcher

Before coming to London for MAM, I was working at **JPMorgan & Chase** as a *Quantitative Researcher*. I worked to create pricing models for equity derivative pricing. 

* The major skills I used while I was working at JP Morgan were:

    + Machine Learning
    + Probability and Statistics
    + Python
    + Predictive Analysis

I look forward to studying the following subjects at LBS:
  + Negotiations

## F1

Apart from working in fintech, I like to watch the F1. I am really excited to attend the *Silverstone Grand Prix*, as I would probably be in the UK at that point of time.
